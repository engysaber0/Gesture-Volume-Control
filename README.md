# Gesture-Volume-Control
Gesture Volume Control is a computer vision-based application that allows users to control their device's volume using hand gestures. Using a camera (webcam or other), this application detects and interprets specific hand movements and adjusts the system's volume accordingly. The goal is to provide an intuitive and hands-free experience for controlling the volume without the need to touch any physical buttons or sliders.

This project utilizes OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to capture and process real-time video feeds for gesture recognition, and PyAutoGUI to control the system's volume.
